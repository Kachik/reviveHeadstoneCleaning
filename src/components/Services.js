      <h1>How to Schedule Service</h1>
      <p>
        Please call us at (818) 945-9762 with the location of the headstone (the

        will schedule the service, and collect cash payment through Venmo,
        Zelle, or cash pick up for additional $9.99 charge.

      <h1>Our Process</h1>
      <p>
        We start by inspecting your headstone to assess the condition and
        determine the best course of action. We then use a gentle, non-abrasive
        cleaning solution to remove dirt, grime, and other debris. We may also
        use a polishing compound to restore the shine to your headstone. Once
        the cleaning is complete, we will take before and after photos to show
        you the difference.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Commitment to Quality</h1>
      <p>
        We are committed to providing our customers with the highest quality of
        service. We are licensed and insured, and we follow all cemetery rules
        and regulations. We also offer free estimates, so you can be sure you're
        getting the best possible price.
